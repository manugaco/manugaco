## About me:

<p align="justify">
  
I am a profesional data scientist with almost five years on the business.
  
I found my passion, the world of data science, while I was studying economics. 

I worked as an intern at the University of Alicante for seven months, developing a new consumption index based on social media data, later it became my final degree thesis.

I studied a Master's degree in statistics for data science at the University Carlos III of Madrid, to improve my knowledge in the data science field.

Once I finished, I was proposed to study a PhD in mathematical engineering at the same university where I completed the first research paper.

I worked at Innova-tsn as Data Scientist for two years, a consulting firm based in Madrid, in the advanced analytics area, developing projects for some important IBEX 35 companies.

I worked at Global Omnium Idrica as Data Scientist for one year, a software development company based in Valencia, in the product department and also in the analytics consulting department and I was promoted to Data Science Manager of the consulting analytics department.

I worked at Intrum-Solvia for 7 months, a debt recovery corporation as Senior Data Scientist.

I am currently working at Accenture as Lead - Consutant Data Scientist managing teams and developing cutting edge products in the supply chain industry.
